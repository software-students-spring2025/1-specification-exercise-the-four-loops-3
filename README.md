## Product Vision Statement
Our app is a student-exclusive marketplace that allows NYU students to trade or give away essential items like textbooks, clothing, and dorm supplies, reducing waste and lowering costs within the campus community.

## User Requirements
1. As an NYU student, I want to contact other students so that I can negotiate the trade and the meeting spots with other students.
2. As a user, I want to be able to filter through the catalog so that I can find specific items that I want to trade for.
3. As a browser, I want to be able to view a brief description of the item so that I can determine if I want the item.
4. As a user, I want to be able to report suspicious listings so that I can keep the platform safe and usable.
5. As a user, I want to receive notifications when new items are listed so that I can stay up to date on what other users are offering.
6. As a lister, I want to be able to mark items as traded or available so that other users know what is still available to them.
7. As a user, I want to see my past listings and trade history so that I can have a record of my transactions.
8. As an international student, I want to quickly trade off items that are not of great importance so that I can travel inexpensively.
9. As a financially-challenged student, I want to exchange items with other students instead of purchasing new ones, so that I can budget efficiently.
10. As a compulsive buyer, I want to connect with other students, so that I can build a supportive network and let go of material possessions. 
11. As an under-calculator,  I want to track inventory lists of common essentials of my peers so that I can better understand my needs and avoid underbuying in the future. 
12. As a first-year student, I want access to essential resources such as textbooks from upperclassmen, so that I have an easier transition into the semester.
